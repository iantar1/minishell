1) need to expand over and over again until there is nothing to expand 
{
	export t="*"
	$t
	output : * command not found     | but output needs to be the * expanded thene passed with the tree
}

2) (buildins) needs exit status
3) export do net set an already seted variable if its just like this (export b) it needs to be (export b=) at least (DONE)
4) expanding needs {
	export t="a b c"
	export r=$t
	echo $r
	output needs to be (a b c) but we got (a "and b c are created")
}

4) env -i segfault  (FIXED "GOT ERROR MESAGE ONLY")
