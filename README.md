# minishell
This project is about creating a simple shell.
-----------

this projet is separate to two part:
	-the Parser and the Executor.

------------------ the Parser ----------------------
The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls ­al” and puts it 
into a data structure called Command Table that will store the commands that will be 
executed. 

------------------ The Executor --------------------

0. take the string and split it.
	
In this README I will explain all this steps of the Parcer part, which is my part of the Project.
