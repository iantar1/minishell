## Introduction
This is a simple shell project developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. The project is divided into two main parts: parsing and execution. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions on how to use and build it.

## Features
- **Parsing**: The parsing component handles the interpretation of user commands, breaking them down into components for execution.
- **Execution**: The execution component executes the parsed commands and manages processes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The shell provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Follow the build and run instructions provided in the next section.
- Once the shell is running, you can enter commands and interact with the shell.
